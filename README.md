# Health insurance cross sell prediction

**Disclaimer**: this project was inspired by the "Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction" challenge published on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction). It is a fictitious project but with all the steps of a real project.

#### This project was made by Renato da Nova Favarin.

# 1. Business Scenario.
This project is to help an insurance company that has provided health insurance to its customers  and now they need to build a model to predict whether the policyholders (customers) from past year will also be interested in vehicle insurance provided by the company. With the limited resources to contact the potential customers interested in vehicle insurance it is necessary to build a customers rank to enhance customer adhesion performance. 

# 2. Business Assumptions.

The Marketing Manager stated that they are only able to offer adequate treatment in the sales campaign - including calls and invitations for conversations in person and clarification of doubts - to approximately 40% of last year's policyholders. Therefore, the company wants to obtain a list of the 40% of customers with health insurance most likely to acquire a car insurance to maximize customer conversion.


# 3. Solution Strategy

when each customer signed up for health insurance during last year, they also completed a survey with relevant data to a car insurance decision-making, such as ownership of a driver's license, vehicle age, wheter the customer got his/ her vehicle damaged in the past, among other information.

The result of this survey will guide the creation of a list of the 40% of customers most likely to purchase this second insurance.

My strategy to solve this challenge was:
